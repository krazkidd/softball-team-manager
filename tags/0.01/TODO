TODO db info must not be hard-coded in php files. Why? Obviously, there are problems having that in several places. Less obviously, it may be easier to get PHP to *not* do it's normal processing and return the file with that sensitive info to an attacker. That info should be in a file that the web server will refuse to serve (like wordpress)
TODO player profiles (and every time the name appears, it should link to the profile)
TODO foreign keys! i.e. player names in the 'team' table should 'point to' some data in a player table. so a team is just a composite of players from the player table
TODO create players table and update team table to use entries in players table as foreign keys
TODO allow different views? i.e. players and managers could have different landing pages after logging in. Or is this only for managers?
TODO need unique IDs for players and leagues and teams, etc.
TODO concurrent db editing?
TODO need to read up on relational tables and figure out how to structure my db with leagues/games/teams/players
TODO have a way to add notes
TODO use javascript for reordering game lineups
TODO need to read up on relational tables and figure out how to structure my db with leagues/games/teams/players

DONE need to find out how to include php files so i can move the lineup display code into a separate file/function
