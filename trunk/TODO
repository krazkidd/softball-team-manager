TODO db info must not be hard-coded in php files. Why? Obviously, there are problems having that in several places. Less obviously, it may be easier to get PHP to *not* do it's normal processing and return the file with that sensitive info to an attacker. That info should be in a file that the web server will refuse to serve (like wordpress)
TODO player profiles (and every time the name appears, it should link to the profile)
TODO foreign keys! i.e. player names in the 'team' table should 'point to' some data in a player table. so a team is just a composite of players from the player table
TODO create players table and update team table to use entries in players table as foreign keys
TODO allow different views? i.e. players and managers could have different landing pages after logging in. Or is this only for managers?
TODO need unique IDs for players and leagues and teams, etc.
TODO concurrent db editing?
TODO need to read up on relational tables and figure out how to structure my db with leagues/games/teams/players
TODO have a way to add notes
TODO use javascript for reordering game lineups
TODO need to read up on relational tables and figure out how to structure my db with leagues/games/teams/players
TODO display relevant (or funny quotes) from deGrasse Tyson or Bill Nye or somebody lol
TODO I really must use prepared statements to be prepared against dats
TODO pictures! how to keep track of file locations? in the database? however i do it, i want to use a hash of player id + salt so the images can't be easily pulled from an attacker
TODO write function to format phone numbers
TODO need a secondary key in players table (i.e. driver's license #) because that would more easily ensure players don't accidentally get grouped together on the player profile page
TODO add nickName column to players table

DONE need to find out how to include php files so i can move the lineup display code into a separate file/function
