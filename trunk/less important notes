* currently i am hard-coding the date var; what to do when date var is not set? ( what is the default case?)

==============================

how do i want to do lineups table? do i make ~15 columns, 1 for each position + subs? does that go against normalization conventions?

what's it called when i duplicate data in different tables? DENORMALIZATION.
Do I want to do this for the lineup/field layout stuff? I need player names but only ID's are in the lineups table, so I have to make several other queries to the db to get all the names
there have been a couple other instances where denormalization would declutter the code; is it worth it? me no know.

should i use thead and tbody? are those in xhtml 1.0?

how to get this to work to select secondary header rows/cells?:
#lineup-whole-form tr th + tr td { /* what are the precedence rules? */

Kight's system could be abused if someone isn't honest about the positions they like/don't like
